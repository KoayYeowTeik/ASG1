Building a website for a clinic to allow patients to understand details of the company better
External users goal:
  The site's users are patients of clinic x, which allow the users to book timings with the     doctor to skip the long queue during extra hours which are then stored to the doctor's account to see the active bookings
  Users can view information about the clinic easily to learn more about it, using a nav bar or using the search tool to find information related in the webpage.
  If a patient fails to comes for more than 3 bookings, his or her account booking is placed as not a priority.
  Real World Application:
  Clearly understand the html,css and Javascript along with other elements such as understanding how html can link to databases such as the MongDB database using react.js or microsoft sql
